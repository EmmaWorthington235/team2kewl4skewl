Meeting 3 - April 25
- We need to include user stories. Things on the project board are not labeled correctly and descriptions are not user stories. Use proper epic names - feature names not ‘testing’
- Release notes are also important. 
- Main goal should be to make the playlist page display all of the backend wizardry we’ve completed.
- Collaborating with a group member to complete a commit actually results in a loss of points.
- The appearance of writing many lines is more important than the progress made by the group.
